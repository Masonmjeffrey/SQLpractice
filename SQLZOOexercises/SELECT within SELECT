1. List each country name where the population is larger than that of Russia
SELECT name 
  From world
     WHERE population >
      (SELECT population FROM world
        WHERE name = 'Russia'
 Here I used a SELECT query within my SELECT query, I want to pull all country names from the world table Where the population is greater than my condition
 To reference the population of Russia within my original SELECT query I had to use another query that grabbed the russian population
 
2. Show Countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than the 'United Kingdom'
 SELECT name 
  FROM world
    WHERE gdp/population > 
      (SELECT gdp/population FROM world
        WHERE name = 'United Kingdom')
     AND continent = 'Europe'
     
3. List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.
SELECT name, continent
  FROM world
    WHERE continent IN 
      (SELECT continent FROM world
        WHERE name IN ('Argentina', 'Australia'))
    ORDER BY name;
Here importantly we used the keyword IN instead of = in two occassions. First to say check Continents IN the parentheses condition and second to check that the name
is IN the list of Argentina and Australia. We used IN instead of = as we have two arguments IN a list to check that our name or continent matches. Not just one. Since we have
to check whether the item we are searching for is IN the list we use IN

4. Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population.
SELECT name, population
  FROM world
    WHERE population >
      (SELECT population
        FROM world
          WHERE name = 'Canada')
     AND population <
        (SELECT population
          FROM world
            WHERE name = 'Poland');
        
 5. Germany population of 80 million has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany. Show the name
 and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.
 SELECT name, 
        ROUND(100*population / (SELECT population
                            FROM world
                              WHERE name = 'Germany'))
 FROM world
 WHERE continent = 'Europe';
 
 6. Which Countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)
 SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE gdp > ALL(SELECT gdp FROM world WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND gdp > 0);

7. Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:
SELECT continent, name, area
  FROM world AS x
    WHERE x.area = (
      SELECT MAX(y.area)
        FROM world AS y
          WHERE x.continent = y.continent)
 X is our outer query iteration and y is our inner query iteration
 
 8. First Country of each Continent (alphabetically), list the continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically
 SELECT continent, name
  FROM world as x
    WHERE x.name = (SELECT min(name)
                      FROM world as y
                        WHERE x.continent = y.continent);
                        
9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name continent
and population.
SELECT name, continent, population 
  FROM world as x
    WHERE 25000000 >= ALL (
      SELECT y.population
        FROM world as y
          WHERE x.continent = y.continent
 10. Some Countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent), give the countries and continents
 SELECT name, continent
 	FROM world AS x
		WHERE x.population > (
			SELECT 3*MAX(y.population)
				FROM world AS y
					WHERE x.continent = y.continent 
                                        AND x.name <> y.name);
